# c_code_generator

##### 这是一个专门生成特定类型数据结构或者算法的代码生成器。C程序本身可以用宏、void\*、类似linux内核的侵入式链表来实现某种程度上的类型泛化，但是宏难于调试，void\*对于这类程序性能不行，侵入式仍然无法避免强制类型转换，且侵入式本身可以放入异质元素，这可能导致某些意外问题。因此，与其疯狂的追逐各类hack技巧去得到一个使用方式上处处受限的残次品，不如退一步，直接对于每种类型单独的给出对应的数据结构。重复编码是没有意义的，因此我编写了这个生成器，并配备 .txt 文件作为模板。生成器原理非常简单，就是读取 txt 文件并替换其中需要替换的文本，类似于C preprocessor 的宏替换，但是生成的代码毕竟是可见可修改的，且类型固定，不需要强制类型转换，可以规避上述方式的问题。

##### This is a code generator specifically designed to generate specific types of data structures or algorithms. The C program itself can achieve some degree of type generalization using macros, void\*, and intrusive linked lists similar to the Linux kernel. However, macros are difficult to debug, and void\* performs poorly for such programs, intrusive programs still cannot avoid forced type conversion, and they can place heterogeneous elements, which may lead to some unexpected problems. Therefore, instead of frantically pursuing various hack techniques to obtain a defective product with limited usage, it is better to take a step back and directly provide corresponding data structures for each type separately. Repeated encoding is meaningless, so I wrote this generator and equipped it with some .txt files as templates. The principle of the generator is very simple, which is to read the .txt file and replace the text that needs to be replaced, similar to the macro replacement in C preprocessor. However, the generated code is visible and modifiable, and the type is fixed, so there is no need for forced type conversion, which can avoid the problems of the above method.
